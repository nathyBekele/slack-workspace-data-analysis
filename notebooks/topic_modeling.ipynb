function?*\\n\\nat its core, a loss function is incredibly simple: it’s a method of evaluating how well your algorithm models your dataset. if your predictions are totally off, your loss function will output a higher number. if they’re pretty good, it’ll output a lower number. as you change pieces of your algorithm to try and improve your model, your loss function will tell you if you’re getting anywhere.\\n\\nloss functions are related to model accuracy, a key component of ai/ml governance.\\n\\nwe can design our own (very) basic loss function to further explain how it works. for each prediction that we make, our loss function will simply measure the absolute difference between our prediction and the actual value. in mathematical notation, it might look something like

describe zero knowledge proofs.\\nnormally, if you want to send a crypto asset, say bitcoin, the network would first verify if you have the said amount of bitcoin in the first place. but for privacy conscious users of blockchain, zero knowledge proof provide a cryptographic proof of ownership without revealing too much information to the network.\\nthough a zero-knowledge proof is a sophisticated method of authenticating a transaction without revealing much details about it, the analogy below breaks down its most basic function.\\n\\nlet's say <@u03uumm7y8h> is colourblind but doesn't know it. now <@u03ukgsdgsg> needs to proof to Elizabeth that there's a difference between green and red. she gives Elizabeth two snooker balls, one green and one red but they are otherwise identical.\\n\\nElizabeth couldn't see the difference and he's pretty skeptical. to verify john's claim that they are indeed different in colour, he device a proof system.\\n\\nElizabeth holds one snooker ball in each hand and put them behind his back. he either switches the balls or just leaves them be.\\n\\nthere's an equal chance of switching and not switching. he then brings them out from his back. john now has to guess whether Elizabeth switched the balls or not. she can know with certainty whether Elizabeth switched the balls just by looking at the colours because she's not colourblind.\\n\\nif she had lied, and the balls were of the same colour, then she only has 50% probability of guessing the switches correctly. so, one try wouldn't be enough to get Elizabeth convinced. Elizabeth and john then go ahead to repeat this proof multiple times.\\n\\nwith each time john gets it right, the chance it was just plan luck goes away. Elizabeth eventually is convinced that the balls are of different colours.\\n\\nthe proof is zero-knowledge because Elizabeth never learns which ball is green and which one is red. he just knows they're different colours.\", '1661434221.694369'), ('very helpful when you try to scale features, the thing is you can only scale numerical features. therefore you need to transform your categorical

sometimes, being aware of the problem can help you take steps to overcome it.\\n• *set small goals*: the thought of completing one huge task can seem daunting. having a list of small and achievable goals can help you tackle each one, in turn, meaning that you make gradual progress towards completion.\\n• *organize your tasks*: the point above feeds into this one. you can stay motivated to accomplish your main goals by creating a precise schedule with dates (daily, weekly and monthly) for when you will achieve each of your smaller goals.\\n•  *focus your attention*: concentrating on some of the simpler activities you need to complete is another method for overcoming procrastination. this is a major confidence booster to achieve set tasks\\n• *remove distractions*: they can easily derail your progress, whether it’s having your phone next to you on your desk or having the tv on in the background. ensure you create a comfortable working environment where distractions can't thrive.\\n• *forgive yourself*: it's easy to punish yourself for putting off tasks. you might tell yourself that you're being ineffective or lazy. in actuality, doing this to yourself doesn't increase productivity; it just makes you feel more agitated and nervous. so learn to forgive yourself always.\\n\", '1666008780.686069'),

resources that will help to advance sql skills:\\n\\n• <https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-sub-queries/|sql subquries>\\n•

third parties, also the available models need to be trained on large amount of data to solve the issue besided it will cost time and money to do that. \\n*proposed solution:*\\n• we used a creative
